## Our Goals

Our mission is to unearth the hidden treasures of Indian mathematics and spotlight the profound contributions of its mathematicians. We aim to bridge historical gaps, shed light on lesser-known scholars, and foster a deep appreciation for India's mathematical heritage. Through research, translation, and education, we aim to restore the historical prominence of Indian mathematics for lasting significance.
